Read Me Generator

https://github.com/korkdaork/readmegen

## Getting Started

You'll need to install the required packages (in terminal utilize the "npm i" command).  Once the file is open in terminal/cmd/vs code terminal, you will need to run it by typing "node ./index.js".  Once the file runs, answer the questions.  After you answer the questions, a file named "test.md" will be generated.  Cut or copy that file into the location you so desire and rename the file to fit your need.  

If any questions arise, visit my page at https://korkdaork.github.io and go to the contact page.  You can send me an e-mail and I will try to get back to you as soon as possible (based on the amount of correspondence I get).
